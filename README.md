# react-redux-boilerplate
React + Redux + Bootstrap + Webpack Boilerplate to get up and running in no time!

# Getting started:
1. Clone this repository
2. npm install
3. npm run serve

There is still a lot to do:

1. Integrate Redux into the mix
2. Add a testing framework
3. Create a sample application
4. Create npm tasks for production build

Have Fun!
